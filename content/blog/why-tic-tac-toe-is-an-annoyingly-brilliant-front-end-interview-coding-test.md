We all know what a [Tic-tac-toe game](https://www.google.com/search?q=tic+tac+toe) is, right? If you click the link, you can even play a nicely made version of it in the search results.

Well, how about implementing it in your favorite front-end frameworks in **less than 30 minutes** with **variable board size and number to win support**?

I tried it and timed it and it's not easy.

What's more, it covers more aspects of how well a person can handle requirements, communication, design, and programming than I originally thought.

Thanks to (or not?) this coding test, I unfortunately have to turn down several candidates who can't even figure out a simple implementation within the time frame.

## What's so good about it?

Let's add more to this principle:

> And whether we want to touch this person's code or not.

Implementing a Tic-tac-toe game shows a surprising amount of technical ability that a capable front-end developer should have to do their job well.

On top of that, it's much more practical than a data structure of algorithm coding problems. You probably won't write a Depth-first search that often, but I am sure you will use most of the things used to implement a Tic-tac-toe game.

## What it takes to implement it

Knowledge & skills about

1. Build tools and a local development environment
2. At least one front-end UI library (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
3. Front-end application states
4. Styling libraries (including vanilla CSS) for basic layout
5. A clean app architecture
